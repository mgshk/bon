		<p>Using your "My Wallet" you can</p>
		<p>1. Add cash to your "My Wallet" anytime, anywhere for doing your day to day shopping.<br> 
You just need to have internet connection. And help the seller to join if he isn't already. It is very simple and free.</p>
		<p>2. You can use "Transfer cash" to get your money back from your wallet to your's or any other bank account of your choice.</p>
		<p>* This will be done with very less service charges which is enforced by the gateway. We are also considering about waiving this charge to the end user and bearing from BoN's pocket based on the user's rating.</p>
